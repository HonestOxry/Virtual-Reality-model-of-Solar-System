# Virtual-Reality-model-of-Solar-System

## Objective
Design and develop a VR-based 3D solar system simulation model to provide an immersive experience using Unity 3D.

## Approach
- **Earth-Centric Scaling:** Implemented Earth-centric scaling to accurately visualize planetary sizes, distances, and dynamics within the solar system.
- **Dynamic Sun Creation:** Utilized the Universal Rendering Pipeline (URP) and Shader Graph to create a dynamic and visually engaging representation of the sun.
- **Enhanced User Interaction:** Improved VR interaction by adding engaging features such as zoom, play/pause, and focus functionalities.

## Result
Developed a fully interactive VR simulation with detailed planetary visualizations and user navigation controls, offering an immersive educational experience.
